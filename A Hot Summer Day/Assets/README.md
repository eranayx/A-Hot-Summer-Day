For the full experience, change the scene to "Loading Screen (Persistent)" and press play. Have fun!

I don't know why the worker has unexpected behavior in the WebGL build on itch. It works fine in Unity.

I would like to have added something for the player to actively do (finding chest, player-only cashier line, etc).
